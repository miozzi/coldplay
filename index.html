During these two years, the band changed names from Pectoralz, to Starfish, and
finally, to Coldplay. Creative director and former manager Phil Harvey is often
referred to as the fifth member by the band. They recorded and released two
EPs: Safety in 1998 and The Blue Room in 1999. The latter was their first
release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.
