  <h2>Viva La Viva</h2>
<p>
  I used to rule the world<br>
  Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
  Now in the morning, I sleep alone<br>
  Sweep the streets I used to own<br>
  I used to roll the dice<br>
  Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br>
  Listen as the crowd would sing<br>
  Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!<br>
  One minute I held the key<br>
  Next the walls were closed on me<br>
  And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
  Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br>
  I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
  Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
  Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
  My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
  For some reason I can't explain<br>
  Once you go there was never, never a honest word<br>
  And that was when I ruled the world<br>
  It was a wicked and wild wind<br>
  Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
  Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
  People couldn't believe what I'd become<br>
  Revolutionaries wait<br>
  For my head on a silver plate<br>
  Just a puppet on a lonely string<br>
  Oh, who would ever want to be king?<br>
  I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
  Roman Calvary choirs are singing<br>
  Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
  My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
  For some reason I can't explain<br>
  I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
  Never an honest word<br>
  But that was when I ruled the world<br>
  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
  I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
  Roman Calvary choirs are singing<br>
  Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
  My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
  For some reason I can't explain<br>
  I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
  Never an honest word<br>
  But that was when I ruled the world<br>
