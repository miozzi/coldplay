  <h2>Ever Glow</h2>
<p>
  Well, they say people come<br>
  The say people go<br>
  This particular diamond was extra special<br>
  And though you might be gone, and the world may not know<br>
  Still I see you, celestial<br>
  And I should but I can't let you go<br>
  But when I'm cold, I'm cold<br>
  Yeah, when I'm cold<br>
  Cold<br>
  There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow<br>
  There's a feeling within me, an everglow<br>
  Like brothers in blood, or sisters who ride<br>
  Yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends 'til we die<br>
  But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow<br>
  Life is short as the falling of snow<br>
  And I'm gonna miss you, I know<br>
  But when I'm cold, cold<br>
  In water rolled, salt<br>
  And I know that you're with me and the way you will show<br>
  And you're with me wherever I go<br>
  And you give me this feeling, this everglow<br>
  What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold<br>
  Because, I live for this feeling, this everglow<br>
  So if you love someone, you should let them know<br>
  Oh, the light that you gave me will everglow<br>
