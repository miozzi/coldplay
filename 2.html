  <h2>Fix You</h2>
<p>
  When you try your best but you don't succeed<br>
  When you get what you want but not what you need<br>
  When you feel so tired but you can't sleep<br>
  Stuck in reverse<br>
  When the tears come streaming down your face<br>
  'Cause you lose something you can't replace<br>
  When you love someone but it goes to waste<br>
  What could it be worse?<br>
  Lights will guide you home<br>
  And ignite your bones<br>
  And I will try to fix you<br>
  But high up above or down below<br>
  When you are too in love to let it show<br>
  Oh but if you never try you'll never know<br>
  Just what you're worth<br>
  Lights will guide you home<br>
  And ignite your bones<br>
  And I will try to fix you<br>
  Tears come streaming down your face<br>
  When you lose something you cannot replace<br>
  oh and tears come streaming down your face<br>
  And I<br>
  Tears streaming down your face<br>
  I promise you I will learn from all my mistakes<br>
  oh and the tears streaming down your face<br>
  And I<br>
  Lights will guide you home<br>
  And ignite your bones<br>
  And I will try to fix you<br>
